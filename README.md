## Source code for fishing websites targeting rolifewhistleblower.com

### Current Sitelist

- [profilewhistleblower.co](https://profilewhistleblower.co)

- [profilewhistleblower.gay](https://profilewhistleblower.gay) (My personal fave)

A copy of the aforementioned terrorist website with various modifications to impede, mislead and all around frustrate users of the site.

Existing Features include:

- Redirects to [Planned Parenthood](https://plannedparenthood.com)
- Modified copy so to tell the truth

In Progress Features:

- Form redirect so that anyone who is reported can be properly cared for.
- Customizable form redirect for sign-up sheet. Currently is does nothing, but by implementing <FUNCTION_NAME> you can customize the form behavior. It's probably not as good idea to collect and publish collected user info, but you are free to do as you see fit.

## Develoment

The site is hacked up compiled js so it's a big mess, but the good news it you serve with any file server. This service serves the source via a Go backend. It is currently a work in progress. For local dev you can just point your browser at `public/index.html`.

## Deployment

I am using Firebase to deploy, but you could easily use Netlify.com 
or 

## Known Issuies:
 
 - The code was pulled directly from the live site so it's compiled js. I depbfiscated 

### Possible Issues:

 - Analytics and metrics gathering may report to rolifewhistleblower.com
 - Who knows what else is reporting back there.
